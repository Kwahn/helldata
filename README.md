Oh wow, a public github!  Didn't really expect to do this - but here we are!

The code's just a simple submission form and PHP script that interfaces with a PostGreSQL database instance on a VPS.  Nothing too fancy, just tries to properly sanitize inputs, submit runs and do some basic error & sanity checking.

All feedback is appreciated!
